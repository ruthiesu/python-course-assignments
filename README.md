instructions:
day01: 
create a program that will print "Hello World!"

day02: 
* Write a program called circle.py that will ask the user for the radius of the circle and will print the area and the circumeference of the circle.
* Write a program called rectangle.py that will ask the user for height and width and calculate the area and the perimeter of the rectangle.

day03:
* Number guessing game - level 0
Create a file called number_guessing_game_0.py
Using the random module the computer "thinks" about a whole number between 1 and 20.
The user has to guess the number. After the user types in the guess the computer tells if this was bigger or smaller than the number it generated, or if it was the same.
The game ends after just one guess.

* Copy the circle.py and rectangle.py from day02 to day03 and change both of them to get the values one the command line (using sys.argv) intead of waiting for input.
